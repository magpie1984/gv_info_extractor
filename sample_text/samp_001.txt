The incident was reported about 4 p.m. near the intersection of Kester Avenue and Sherman Way.

LAPD were following a possible stolen vehicle when the occupants inside allegedly fired gunshots at a police vehicle. Police requested help and continued following the vehicle until it crashed into a light pole, Sgt. Barry Montgomery said.

The driver of the vehicle got out and was shot by police. Aerial video showed the man being treated at the scene before he was taken to a hospital and was eventually declared dead, Montgomery said.

It is unclear if the man was armed at the time of the shooting, or whether he exchanged gunfire with police.

The two people who were taken into custody at the scene were described only as being females.
