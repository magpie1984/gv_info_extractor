PUYALLUP, Wash. (AP) - The Pierce County Sheriff's Office says a 31-year-old man shot and killed his 34-year-old girlfriend and then himself inside her home near Puyallup.
The News Tribune reports (http://is.gd/MDGo2c ) that the victim's teenage daughter and sister found the bodies about 1:30 a.m. Monday.
Investigators said the woman lived at a duplex and that the man, with whom she had an on-again, off-again relationship, did not live there.
Sheriff's spokesman Ed Troyer said the shooting likely happened late Saturday or early Sunday, but neighbors did not hear the shots.
