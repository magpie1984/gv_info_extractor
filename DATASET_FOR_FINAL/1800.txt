A bear was shot in an Auburn neighborhood Saturday morning by a man who said the animal was starting to charge at him and his dog.
It was a black bear weighing about 300 pounds.
The man who shot the bear, who did not want to be identified, said the bear had killed at least six chickens earlier that morning and was at his doorstep ready to attack him and his dog.
According to the man, he tried calling authorities, but claimed their response time was slow. He said an hour passed before the bear returned and he was forced to take matters into his own hands.
"He had to have had some type of fear for himself and his animals," said neighbor Earlene Olson.  "He's an animal lover."
Others say the shooting could have been prevented.  "Black bears aren't necessarily looking for you or your children or your dogs," said Cindy McAyeal with the Bear League - a nonprofit that works to keep bears safe in their natural habitat.  "You need a depredation permit to legally take a bear unless your life is in danger.  This situation, I don't know the situation, I wasn't there," said McAyeal.
The man said he didn't want to shoot the bear but he didn't know what else to do.
