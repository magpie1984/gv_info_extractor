According to the victim and witnesses, the injured man was manipulating the gun while sitting in the drivers seat of the vehicle, Lee said in a news release. The weapon discharged and a round entered the mans right leg, apparently breaking the femur. The mans friends drove towards Lander and were eventually intercepted by Deputy Sheriffs and the Fremont County Ambulance.
