AUGUSTA, Maine â€” A Maine man will spend 10 years in jail for inadvertently shooting a man in the leg during an evening of dinner and games.
A judge sentenced 32-year-old Paul Nicholas Coyne of Winthrop on Wednesday. He pleaded guilty to aggravated assault and illegal possession of a firearm in June.
The Kennebec Journal (http://bit.ly/1CWQyUw) reports a sentencing memo by Coyne's attorney says victim Josh Belyea tried to grab a firearm in Coyne's hand, which resulted in a struggle. The firearm then discharged and Belyea was shot in the leg. The men had become embroiled in a fight at the end of a night of dinner, drinks and games at a woman's apartment in Gardiner.
Coyne also admitted violating probation and will receive a 42-month probation revocation.
