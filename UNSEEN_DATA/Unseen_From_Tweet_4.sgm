NORTHERN LIBERTIES (WPVI) -- Philadelphia police are investigating a deadly shooting and possible stabbing at a recording studio in the city's Northern Liberties section.
It happened in the basement of a recording studio at 444 North 3rd Street.
Police first arrived around 7:30 Saturday morning and found the 30-year-old man shot in the head and back, and a bloody screwdriver nearby, indicating the victim may have also been stabbed. He died at the scene.
The building houses Superior Sound Studio, which according to its Facebook page rents out studio time to artists.
Police haven't released the name of the victim or the circumstances surrounding his death.
In a text, the studio owner wrote: "I don't know what happened at this time. I am seeing the image of my life's dream being destroyed. I am just a little too distraught to talk."
